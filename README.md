# Nvim configuration

This project customizes your nvim to look much better than the default one



## Installation

You need to install:
- nvim v8 and above (latest version recommended)
- nodejs and npm

```bash
  apt install nodejs npm 

  ## clone the repository 
  git clone ...

  ## move or copy the file to this directory
  ~/.config

  if it already exits then delete the old one and
  replace it with this one

  ## open nvim and let everything install and
     open it again to make sure everything is installed

 
```

# Note

  ## i added two things in the **options.lua** file, line 40 and 43 which were giving me problems

  line 40 is for disabling the list option in which it was displaying a **dollar sign "$"** at the end of every line

  line 43 is for having a line cursor in insert mode and a block cursor when out of insert mode

```
